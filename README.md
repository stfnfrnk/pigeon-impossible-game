# Pigeon Impossible: The Avian Apocalypse

Welcome to "Pigeon Impossible," where the birds have had enough of your nonsense and are fighting back! This isn't your grandma's bird-feeding simulator - it's pure, unadulterated pigeon pandemonium!

## What's the Deal?

You're just an innocent bystander trying to navigate the mean streets of Pigeon City. But these feathered fiends have other plans. They're dropping "presents" from above, and trust us, you don't want these gifts!

## Let's play / Demo:
[Play Pigeon Impossible here on Github](https://stfnfrnk.github.io/pigeon-impossible-game/)

## Features:

1. **Raining Chaos**: Catch those refreshing raindrops like your life depends on it (because it does)! But beware the occasional poisonous green drop - it's not a power-up, it's a power-down! Who knew acid rain could be so literal?

2. **The Golden Shower**: No, not that kind! Catch the rare golden poops for extra points. It's like a lottery, but messier.

3. **Kamikaze Pigeons**: Sometimes, these birds just give up on life and fall from the sky. Is it your fault? Probably.

4. **Splash Zone**: Get hit by pigeon poop, and watch it explode in a glorious display of particle effects. It's gross, but oddly satisfying.

5. **Escalating Insanity**: The longer you survive, the crazier it gets. It's like the pigeons are chugging energy drinks up there!

## Warning:

This game may cause an irrational fear of pigeons, an aversion to parks, and a sudden urge to carry an umbrella at all times. Play at your own risk!

Remember, in the world of "Pigeon Impossible," the sky's not the limit - it's the threat. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor (unlike those poor, falling pigeons)!
